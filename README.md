# Mineflayer Lavacast Bot

This bot is designed to build a lavacast until it can no longer build up to the Y limit. Currently, it does not have a progress system, which means if it loses connection while working, it will have to start over.

The purpose could be for early-stage anarchy servers that may need lavacast; however, if you prefer not to intervene and let them run naturally, that's fine. This bot is also for those who love lavacasts (which is quite strange).

## Features

- **Automated Construction**: Builds a lavacast structure automatically.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily modify parameters to suit your needs.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Utilizes resources efficiently during construction.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) library

## Installation
